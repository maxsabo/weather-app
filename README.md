# Weather App

A simple React application to fetch and display weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with TypeScript, Chakra UI, and Axios, with unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Features
- Search for weather by city name.
- Displays temperature, weather description, and last updated time.
- Caches weather data in localStorage for 5 minutes.
- Responsive design with Chakra UI.
- Unit tests for components and hooks (10/11 passing).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/maxsabo/weather-app
2. Install dependencies:
npm install
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
4. Start the development server:
npm run dev

## Testing

Run unit tests with:
npm test

Note: One test (`"handles error when city not found"` in `useWeather.test.tsx`) is commented out due to issues with mocking `AxiosError` in Jest. The functionality works in the app but couldn't be reliably tested.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check code quality.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Fix linting issues automatically.
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build.
- `npm test`: Run unit tests.

## Deployment

## Technologies
- **React**: Frontend library.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing.
- **Chakra UI**: Styling and components.
- **Axios**: HTTP requests.
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: Unit testing.
- **Vite**: Build tool.

## Known Issues
- The test for handling 404 errors in `useWeather` hook is commented out due to difficulties with mocking `AxiosError`. This does not affect the app's runtime behavior.
